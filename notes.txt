1. Using the array allows me to understand that there are two things need by the array.
First, you have to consider the content and where you want to put
Second, you have to correctly position the content so that you easily reference it with indexing.

Sorting an Array
 The Insertion-sort Algorithm is a type of Algorithm which considers one element at a time, usually placing the element in the correct order relative to those before it.
 1. Starting the Algorithm , I consider the first element in the array, if it is smaller than the first which usually sorts itself. 
 2. Then next step is to consider the next element in the array, if it is smaller we then swap them. 
 3. I then consider the third element in the array and repeat step 2, if and only if the element is less than itself. 
 4. Consider the four element and repeat the steps.

 Pseudocode is show bellow

 Algorithm InsertSort (A):
    Input: Give a certain comparable elements
    Ouput: an order array of elements in non-descending order.
    Iterate:
        for j from 1 to n - 1
            do Insert A[j] at the proper position with A[0] , A[1] ... A[j]
